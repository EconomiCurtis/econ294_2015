Put solutions in a `.R` script file. Name the file by concatinating your first and last name, plus "Assignment1". (e.g. my file would be called `CurtisKephartAssignment1.R`)


1. Load Data and verify it was loaded correctly. (Hints, you will need different function calls for each file type, and the .dta file requires the `foreign` package.)

  + From .dta (STATA File). Assign the name `df.dta` to the file. 
  
`https://github.com/EconomiCurtis/econ294_2015/raw/master/data/NHIS_2007_dta.dta`
  
  + From CSV. Assign the name df.csv to the file. 

`https://github.com/EconomiCurtis/econ294_2015/raw/master/data/NHIS_2007_CSV.csv`

  + From Tab deliniated. Assign the name df.td to the file. 
  
`https://github.com/EconomiCurtis/econ294_2015/raw/master/data/NHIS_2007_TSV.txt`

  + From .RData. Assign the name df.rdata to the file. 
  
  `https://github.com/EconomiCurtis/econ294_2015/raw/master/data/NHIS_2007_RData.RData`

2. Download each file to your hard drive, how big (in KB) is each file? Which is the smallest? 

3. For the object `df.rdata`, what type of data structure is this?

length, dim, nrow, ncol, summary stats functions. 

2. c function.

summary stats with NA and NULL values. 

3. Matrix operations. 

Create the following matrix and call it `x`. 

$$\begin{array}
{rrr}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{array}
$$

Show how to find it's transpose. 

Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of `x`. 

Now create the following matrix and call it `y`.

$$\begin{array}
{rrr}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
3 & 2 & 1 \\
2 & 3 & 0
\end{array}
$$

Find the inverse of `y`. 

Multiple `y` by its inverse. What is this new matrix called? 

4. Create a data frame.

carat | cut         | clarity | price
----- | ------      | ------- | -----
5     | "fair"      | "SI1"   | 850
2     | "good"      | "I1"    | 450
0.5   | "very good" | "VI1"   | 450
1.5   | "good"      | "VS1"   | NULL
5     | "fair"      | "IF"    | 750
NA    | "Ideal"     | "VVS2"  | 980
3     | "fair"      | "SI1"   | 420
